# Chip Overclock速 is the Pen Name of John Sloan

Chip Overclock速 is a megalomaniacal supervillain and the secret
identity, pseudonym, alter ego, and registered trademark of John
Sloan, a technology product developer who writes software and
firmware for very large and very small systems on the internet of
interesting things: distributed, real-time, high performance, high
reliability, embedded, concurrent, parallel, asynchronous, bleeding
edge, high altitude, close to bare metal. John works in the telecommunications,
big science, enterprise, industrial, academic, defense, and
intelligence domains.

John founded the Digital Aggregates Corporation速 for his open source
work and his consulting practice, and Cranequin LLC for his closed
source and otherwise proprietary work. He writes a blog under his
pseudonym on the business and technology of software development
to entertain his friends. John has co/authored an article in the
Proceedings of the IEEE, an entry in the Encyclopedia of Computer
Science, and many conference papers and technical reports. He is
the co/inventor of two patents. John has served on industry and
academic advisory panels, has been an invited conference speaker,
and has served as a visiting scientist and consultant domestically
and abroad. John has worked with remote engineering teams in such
exotic locales as China, India, Australia, Scotland, Ireland, England,
and New Jersey.

John has written, probably, hundreds of thousands of lines of code in
C and C++ for products that shipped, but has also written production code
in Java, Python, JavaScript, even FORTRAN, COBOL, a smattering of assembly languages, and has
noodled around in Go and Rust. He has written code for products
ranging from huge, internationally distributed, telecommunications
systems to tiny microcontrollers. His work has given him the excuse
to use oscilloscopes and logic analyzers and other expensive tools, crawl around in the
equipment bays of business jets, spend his days working inside a
SCIF, play with Iridium and Inmarsat communications satellites,
hack Android phone internals, develop protocol stacks for cellular base stations,
wander around the computer room of a supercomputer center at a national
lab, sit tangled in cables and fibers on the floor of a big corporate telecom
center, teach classrooms full of undergraduate and graduate students,
give many successful executive presentations, and travel around Europe and Asia.
His favorite part of his career is how many smart and gracious people he has worked with
who were so generous with their time and expertise.

Due perhaps to his broad skill set, John has been described by former
managers as "a renaissance man" and as "unfocused".
