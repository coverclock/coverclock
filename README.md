Chip Overclock® is a megalomaniacal supervillain and the secret identity, pseudonym, alter ego, and
registered trademark of John Sloan, a technology product developer who writes software and
firmware for very large and very small systems on the internet of interesting things: distributed,
real-time, high performance, high reliability, embedded, concurrent, parallel, asynchronous,
bleeding edge, close to bare metal. John works in the telecommunications, big science, enterprise,
industrial, academic, defense, and intelligence domains. John founded the Digital Aggregates
Corporation® for his open source work and his consulting practice, and Cranequin LLC for his
closed source and otherwise proprietary work. He writes a blog on the business and technology of
software developent under his pseudonym to entertain his friends. John has written, probably,
hundreds of thousands of lines in C and C++ for products that shipped, but has also written production
code in Java, Python, JavaScript, and various assembly languages, and has even noodled around in
Go and Rust. He has written code for products ranging from huge, internationally distributed,
telecommunications systems to tiny microcontrollers. His work has given him the excuse
to use oscilloscopes and logic analyzers, crawl around in the equipment bays of business jets,
spend his days working inside a SCIF, play with Iridium and Inmarsat communications satellites,
wander around the floor of a supercomputer center at a national lab, sit tangled in cables and
fibers at a big corporate telecom center, teach classrooms full of undergraduate and graduate
students, give many executive presentations, and travel to Europe and Asia.
